# DevOps-Learning--BASH

**Shebang Line**

Shebang is also known has the #bang which is a crucial tool in the execution of the bash script. 
**#!/bin/bash** is known as the "shebang line" and serves as the directive to the operating system on how to interpret the script.
In this case, we are asking the operating system to interpret the script using the binary bash. 
The "!" denotes to the specific interpretor on whcih shell should handle the script. 
To show this, I created a new file "touch greet.sh. Then I edited the file by going in "vi greet.sh". I added the text starting with the shebang line. ":wq!" saved and exited the file. Then ensured the script was executable by adding "chmod +x greet.sh". Then when the command "./ greet.sh" was ran, it would give the output of the message in the file.

**Comments**

Comments are lines in the script that are not executed as part of the code. Instead they serve as informative text for us to read the script. 
Adding comments to the script is considered as best practice because it helps you and others to understand the purpose, functionality and logic of the script.
To add comments, it always begins with "#".
Comments are added in the vim editor in this case, it is with the extension.sh file. 
Comments are made within the "'" quotation marks.
